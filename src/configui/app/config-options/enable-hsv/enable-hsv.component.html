    There are other cameras connected through the same station as this device. One station can only ever stream from one camera at the same time.
    Therefore it is not possible to use HomeKit Secure Video with this camera since this would lead to conflicts.<p></p>
    Cameras on the same station:
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let sn of camerasOnSameStation">{{ sn }}</li>

  <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" *ngIf="chargingStatus === 2 && value">
    Since your device is battery powered and currently not charging we don't recommend using this setting. The battery life will most likely decrease significantly.
  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" *ngIf="chargingStatus === 4 && value">
    Please be advised that since your device is only solar powered we cannot guarantee optimal results with this setting. It might well be, that your battery is depleting faster than it can be recharged by the sun. This depends heavily on your exact use case.

    This feature is in an experimental state and can have some side-effects due to technical limitations imposed by the connection to the eufy device.
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The device will record until the HomeKit-Controller cancels the recording, or up to a maximum of three minutes. However Apple analyzes the recorded video and only shows the snippets containing an actual event.</li>
      <li>Due to the continued recording the power consumption will be higher than with the native recording through the eufy app. Keep this in mind, if you use battery powered devices.</li>
      <li>If you use low performance hardware the recording might interfere with livestreaming. You might be able to utilize the 'copy' preset in advanced configuration to mitigate this.</li>
