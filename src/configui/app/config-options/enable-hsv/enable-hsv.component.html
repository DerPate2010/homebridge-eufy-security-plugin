    This feature is in an experimental state and can have some side-effects due to technical limitations imposed by the connection to the eufy device.
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The device will record until the HomeKit-Controller cancels the recording, or up to a maximum of three minutes. However Apple analyzes the recorded video and only shows the snippets containing an actual event.</li>
      <li>Due to the continued recording the power consumption will be higher than with the native recording through the eufy app. Keep this in mind, if you use battery powered devices.</li>
      <li>If you use low performance hardware the recording might interfere with livestreaming. You might be able to utilize the 'copy' preset in advanced configuration to mitigate this.</li>
